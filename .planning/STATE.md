# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-29)

**Core value:** A public, shareable URL that shows today's Lynch/Graham buy signals — no Google account, no friction, just open the link.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — interactive-dashboard

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (interactive-dashboard) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-31

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Commit `results.json` to repo — eliminates all external dependencies; data versioned in git
- Full Google removal (not dual-write) — eliminate all Google friction; CLN phase is LAST (safety net until pipeline confirmed)
- Static frontend (no framework) — no build step; vanilla JS + Tabulator via CDN

### Pending Todos

- **03-02-PLAN.md** — `docs/methodology.html` not yet built. Must complete before Phase 4.
  Run `/gsd:execute-phase 3` after `/clear` to execute Wave 2.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 1 resolved all known blockers:

- SEC-02: Key found in history (commit fc1fb53), scrubbed with git filter-repo — history is clean.
- CI-06: `.gitignore` exception added — `docs/data/results.json` is now trackable.
