# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-29)

**Core value:** A public, shareable URL that shows today's Lynch/Graham buy signals — no Google account, no friction, just open the link.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — google & tiingo cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-31

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Commit `results.json` to repo — eliminates all external dependencies; data versioned in git
- Full Google removal (not dual-write) — eliminate all Google friction; CLN phase is LAST (safety net until pipeline confirmed)
- Static frontend (no framework) — no build step; vanilla JS + Tabulator via CDN

### Pending Todos

- **03-02-PLAN.md** — `docs/methodology.html` not yet built. Must complete before Phase 4.
  Run `/gsd:execute-phase 3` after `/clear` to execute Wave 2.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 1 resolved all known blockers:

- SEC-02: Key found in history (commit fc1fb53), scrubbed with git filter-repo — history is clean.
- CI-06: `.gitignore` exception added — `docs/data/results.json` is now trackable.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| v2 | Advanced numeric range filter sliders | Deferred | Roadmap init |
| v2 | Historical results archive — 1 snapshot/month, rolling 5-year window; accessible via dashboard date picker or archive page | Deferred | Phase 3 |
| v2 | Column header auto-sizing — dynamically fit column widths to header label text so no headers are clipped on load | Deferred | Phase 3 |
| v2 | Dark mode toggle | Deferred | Roadmap init |
| v2 | Column visibility picker | Deferred | Roadmap init |
| v2 | Methodology sourcing — add citations to original Lynch/Graham writings and interviews for each criterion on methodology.html (e.g. One Up on Wall Street for Lynch PEG thresholds, The Intelligent Investor chapters for Graham formulas and defensive checklist) | Deferred | Phase 3 |
